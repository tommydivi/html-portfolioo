<h1>The Best Movies According to Tom Diviney</h1>
    <h2>My top 5 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Goodfellas</h3>
    <p>A timeless classic and endlessly rewatchable. De Niro on top form, and Pesci playing a despicable, yet hilarious mobster loon.</p>

<h3>One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest</h3>
    <p>Hilarious and forever quotable. The launch-pad of many well-known actors and home to possibly the most evil villain in movie history - Nurse Ratchett.</p>

<h3>This Is Spinal Tap</h3>
    <p>One of the funniest movies of all time. Stands the test of time and inspired the pseudo-documentary style of film making. This movie dials it up to 11.</p>
